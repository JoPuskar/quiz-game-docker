## **Setup Instructions**

### **Prerequisites**
- Docker installed on your machine. [Install Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
- Git (optional, for cloning the repository)

### **Steps to Run the Application**

#### **Clone the Repository (if not already cloned):**
```sh
git clone https://github.com/JoPuskar/quiz-game-docker.git
cd quiz-game-docker
```

#### **Build the Docker Image:**
```sh
docker build -t quiz-game:1.0 .
```

#### **Run the Docker Container:**
```sh
docker run -it -v $(pwd)/results:/app/results quiz-game:1.0
```

#### **Check Results:**
The quiz results will be saved in the `results/quiz_results.txt` file on your local machine.

## **Usage Examples**

### **Running the Quiz Game**
When you run the container, the quiz game will start.

### **Viewing Results**
After completing the quiz, check the `results/quiz_results.txt` file:
```sh
cat results/quiz_results.txt
```

## **Explanation of Docker Concepts Used**

### **1. Dockerfile**
The `Dockerfile` defines the environment and steps to build the Docker image.

**Key components:**
- **Base Image:** `python:3.9-slim` is used as the base image to ensure Python is available.
- **WORKDIR:** Sets the working directory inside the container to `/app`.
- **COPY:** Copies the `quiz_game.py` script into the container.
- **ENTRYPOINT:** Specifies the command to run when the container starts (`python quiz_game.py`).
- **VOLUME:** Mounts a volume to persist quiz results outside the container.

### **2. Volume Mounting**
The `-v $(pwd)/results:/app/results` flag in the `docker run` command mounts a local directory (`results`) to the container's `/app/results` directory.

This ensures that quiz results are saved on your local machine and persist even after the container is stopped.

### **3. Interactive Mode**
The `-it` flag in the `docker run` command enables interactive mode and allocates a pseudo-TTY, allowing the quiz game to accept user input.
